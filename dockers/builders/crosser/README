 You need to use the very crosser version that freeciv
 sources expect. This version of the container can
 be used only for building those freeciv revisions that
 expect crosser version mentioned in input/crosser-ver.sh.

-------------------------------------------------------------

To create the builder container:

- Dowload crosser win64stack-full.<version>.7z package
  to input/ directory.
> ./build_docker.sh [freeciv uid]

The [freeciv uid] is the uid of the freeciv user inside
the container, defaulting to $UID of the user running
build_docker.sh script.

-------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to adjust the container after that, you can run
a shell, with root permissions, inside it:
> ./docker_shell.sh [srcdir]

Use 'su - freeciv' to switch to the account that usually
does the build (e.g. to test some build step manually)

-------------------------------------------------------------

The build happens with:
> ./docker_run.sh [srcdir]

Default for [srdir] is 'src/main' under current directory.
Note that build happens inside the source tree, and is writing there.
